)

EMPS(empno,nam,basic)

create table emps
(
   empno int,nam varchar(16),basic float
)


If you want to get the help about the particular table, then you need the help of 

sp_help table_name 


If you want to rename the table, then you need the help of 

sp_rename oldname,newname

truncate command : This command is used to delete all the records from the table. 

By using delete command also you can delete all the records from the table, then the difference between delete and truncate is, 

by using delete command, you can reget the deleted records if you want, but once u invoke the truncate command you never reget the records.
