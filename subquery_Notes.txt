Subqueries : 
_____________

Sometimes its not possible to extract data by using single SELECT Statement, for this we need the help of subqueries. 

A subquery is a query, that which is having another query inside. The query which is inside known as inner query, 
the query which is outside known as outer query. Everytime, the result of the inner query will be send as input to the outer query. 


1) How to Display Max. Salary 

select max(sal) from Emp;

2) Display name of the person who is getting max. salary 

select ename from emp where sal=max(sal);

Display IDLE Agents 

If subquery returns more than one value, then we have to use 2 operators as 

ALL 

ANY 

ALL acts as AND Operator

ANY acts as OR Operator 


EMPNO<> ALL(10,20,30) means 

Empno<> 10 AND Empno <> 20 AND Empno <> 30 


EMPNO <> ANY(10,20,30) Means 

Empno <> 10 OR Empno <> 20 OR Empno <> 30 



select empno,sum(sal) from Emp 
where sum(sal) > 5000;

-- aggregate functions cannot be used in where clause


select * from Customer where customerId = (select CustomerId from Orders);

-- Subquery returns more than one value.

select empno,ename,sal from Emp
having sal > 3000;

-- Having only used to aggregates.

There are different types of commands in SQL as 


1) DDL  -> Data Definition Language 


		Create, Alter, Drop, Truncate 

2) DML  -> Data Manipulation Language. 

	INSERT  - used to add new records
	UPDATE  -> Used to modify existing records

	Update table_name set Field1=value,field2=value {where condition} 

	DELETE  -> Used to delete unnecessary records. 

3) DQL

4) DCL 



DataTypes : 
______________

INT,
FLOAT,
DOUBLE,
numeric,
char(10)
varchar(10) 
date,
enum

'123',

char(10) assume you are using only 5 characters then remaining memory will be wasted. 

varchar(10) assume you are using only 5 characters remaining memory will be added back. 

enum

Employ(Empno,Name,Dept,Desig,Basic) 

	Empno -> int
	Name -> varchar(30),
	Dept -> varchar(30)
	Desig -> varchar(30)
	Basic -> number 


Empno -> Primary Key
Name -> NOT NULL

You can create a table as 

CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME 

Data Integrity : It is imp. to ensure that the data stored in tables is complete and consistent.  The concept of maintaining consistency and completeness of data is called data integrity.  It is enforced to ensure that the data in the database is accurate, consistent and reliable.  

1) Entity Integrity : Ensures that each row can be uniquely identified by an attribute called the primary key. The primary key column contains unique value in all the rows. This column cannot be NULL. 

2) Domain Integrity : Ensures that only a valid range of values is stored in a column. It can be enforced by restricting the type of data.  For suppose the dept field need to contain the list of values as 'computers' or 'physics' or 'maths' then it is coming under the part of domain integrity. 

3) Referential Integrity : Ensures that the values of the foreign key match the values of the corresponding primary key. 



Student(Sno,Name,DateOfBirth,Sub1,Sub2,Sub3,Total,Aveg) 

Sno -> Primary Key
Name -> Not Null

Employee(Empno+,Ename,Job,Gender,City)
Accounts(Empno-,AccountID+,Salary,SalDate)

Empno => Auto_Increment 

AccountID => Auto Increment 

Empno is foreign key in Accounts table 

Alter command used to add/modify/delete columns from the given table. 

How to add a column 

Alter table table_name add column data_type;

To modify the column 

alter table table_name modify column new_type;

To drop a column 

alter table table_name drop column column_name;
