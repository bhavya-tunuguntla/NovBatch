Subqueries : 
_____________

Sometimes its not possible to extract data by using single SELECT Statement, for this we need the help of subqueries. 

A subquery is a query, that which is having another query inside. The query which is inside known as inner query, 
the query which is outside known as outer query. Everytime, the result of the inner query will be send as input to the outer query. 


1) How to Display Max. Salary 

select max(sal) from Emp;

2) Display name of the person who is getting max. salary 

select ename from emp where sal=max(sal);

Display IDLE Agents 

If subquery returns more than one value, then we have to use 2 operators as 

ALL 

ANY 

ALL acts as AND Operator

ANY acts as OR Operator 


EMPNO<> ALL(10,20,30) means 

Empno<> 10 AND Empno <> 20 AND Empno <> 30 


EMPNO <> ANY(10,20,30) Means 

Empno <> 10 OR Empno <> 20 OR Empno <> 30 



select empno,sum(sal) from Emp 
where sum(sal) > 5000;

-- aggregate functions cannot be used in where clause


select * from Customer where customerId = (select CustomerId from Orders);

-- Subquery returns more than one value.

select empno,ename,sal from Emp
having sal > 3000;

-- Having only used to aggregates.
